# Dimf
An open source MtG oracle and image fetcher for discord.
Nothing spectacular, but it does it's job fine.

In order for this bot to work, it needs the following few things:
  - Your auth key for a bot account on discord in the ./config/config.json file.
  - AllSets-x,json, AllCards-x.json from mtgjson.com in the ./data/ folder. (It will scream at you!)

Feel free to reuse anything from this project, but I'd appreciate it if you linked me what you do with it!
